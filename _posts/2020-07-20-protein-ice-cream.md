This recipe is made by [@Greg Doucette](https://www.gregdoucette.com) and since he has this information public in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q-m_6M6nUd8) so I took the liberty of listing the ingredients for my convenience and the general public. Consider buying his cookbook, there are lots of great substitutes and cooking ideas!

* 1.5 scooops of protein
* 105g of frozen fruit (low carb berries)

2. Continuously blend until thickened and does not spill when flipping the blender
